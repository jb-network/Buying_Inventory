# Buying_Inventory
This is a simple program for the Level 10  "Buying Inventory" challenge in the "C# Players Guide".
This challenge is to build a simple menu system to display prices of selected items
The challenge requires the use of either switch statments or switch expressions
My focus for this exercise is to use switch statments
